# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
#
# To see which files will be uploaded, run the following command:
#  $ gcloud meta list-files-for-upload
#
.gcloudignore
# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files
# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line
# below:
.git
.gitignore

# Local dependencies
lib/
# Python pycache
__pycache__/
# macOS metadata file

# Python type annotation files
